Questions,Answers
What is the difference between file structure and storage structure?,Storage structure: It is the representation of the data structure in the computer memory. File structure: It is the representation of the storage structure in the auxiliary memory.
 What is a postfix expression?,An expression in which operators follow the operands is known as postfix expression. The main benefit of this form is that there is no need to group sub-expressions in parentheses or to consider operator precedence.
Which notations are used in Evaluation of Arithmetic Expressions using prefix and postfix forms?,Polish and Reverse Polish notations.
Define Linked List Data structure,"Linked List is the collection of randomly stored data objects called nodes. In Linked List, each node is linked to its adjacent node through a pointer. A node contains two fields, i.e. Data Field and Link Field."
How can AVL Tree be useful in all the operations as compared to Binary search tree?,"AVL tree controls the height of the binary search tree by not letting it be skewed. The time taken for all operations in a binary search tree of height h is O(h). However, it can be extended to O(n) if the BST becomes skewed (i.e. worst case). By limiting this height to log n, AVL tree imposes an upper bound on each operation to be O(log n) where n is the number of nodes."
"In what scenario, Binary Search can be used?",Binary Search algorithm is used to search an already sorted list. The algorithm follows divide and conqer approach
 What are the advantages of Binary search over linear search?,"There are relatively less number of comparisons in binary search than that in linear search. In average case, linear search takes O(n) time to search a list of n elements while Binary search takes O(log n) time to search a list of n elements."
What are Binary trees?,"A binary Tree is a special type of generic tree in which, each node can have at most two children. Binary tree is generally partitioned into three disjoint subsets, i.e. the root of the node, left sub-tree and Right binary sub-tree."
Define the tree data structure.,The Tree is a recursive data structure containing the set of one or more data nodes where one node is designated as the root of the tree while the remaining nodes are called as the children of the root. The nodes other than the root node are partitioned into the nonempty sets where each one of them is to be called sub-tree.
What does abstract data type means?,Data type is a collection of values and a set of operations on these values. Abstract data type refer to the mathematical concept that define the data type. It is a useful tool for specifying the logical properties of a data type
What is sequential search?,In sequential search each item in the array is compared with the item being searched until a match occurs. It is applicable to a table organized either as an array or as a linked list.
Can we apply binary search algorithm to a sorted linked list?,"No we cannot apply binary search algorithm to a sorted linked list, since there is no way of indexing the middle element in the list. This is the drawback in using linked list as a data structure."
What do you mean by free pool?,Pool is a list consisting of unused memory cells which has its own pointer.
What do you mean by garbage collection?,"It is a technique in which the operating system periodically collects all the deleted space onto the free storage list.It takes place when there is minimum amount of space left in storage list or when ""CPU is ideal. The alternate method to this is to immediately reinsert the space into free storage list which is time consuming."
What do you mean by overflow?, When new data is to be inserted into the data structure but there is no available space i.e. free storage list is empty this situation is called overflow.
What do you mean by underflow?,When we want to delete data from a data structure that is empty this situation is called underflow.
Is any implicit arguments are passed to a function when it is called?,"Yes there is a set of implicit arguments that contain information necessary for the function to execute and return correctly. One of them is return address which is stored within the function's data area, at the time of returning to calling program the address is retrieved and the function branches to that location."
"Parenthesis is never required in Postfix or Prefix expressions, why?",Parenthesis is not required because the order of the operators in the postfix/prefix expressions determines the actual order of operations in evaluating the expression
What is a spanning Tree?,A spanning tree is a tree associated with a network. All the nodes of the graph appear on the tree once. A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree organized so that the total edge weight between nodes is minimized.
What is Hashing?,Hashing is the process of mapping a given value with a particular key for faster access of elements. Efficiency of mapping depends of the efficiency of the hash function used.
Explain Greedy algorithm?,"Algorithms following greedy approach build up solution step by step. It is mostly used in optimization problems. It makes optimal choice at each step, to solve entire problem."
Explain me the concept of Priority Queue?,Priority queue is the collection of elements such that each element has been assigned a priority i.e order in which elements are deleted or processed. An element of high priority is processed before any element of lower priority.
Explain the concept of Huffman coding?,It is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is used for lossless data compression. It is an example of Greedy algorithm. It assigns variable length code to all the characters. The code length of a character depends on how frequently it occurs in the given text. The character which occurs most frequently gets the smallest code. The character which occurs least frequently gets the largest code.
Why we need to do algorithm analysis?,"A problem can be solved in more than one ways. So, many solution algorithms can be derived for a given problem. We analyze available algorithms to find and implement the best suitable algorithm."
What is asymptotic analysis of an algorithm?,"Asymptotic analysis of an algorithm, refers to defining the mathematical boundation/framing of its run-time performance. Using asymptotic analysis, we can very well conclude the best case, average case and worst case scenario of an algorithm."
What is shell sort?,"Shell sort can be said a variant of insertion sort. Shell sort divides the list into smaller sublist based on some gap variable and then each sub-list is sorted using insertion sort. In best cases, it can perform upto ?(n log n)."
How Kruskal's algorithm works?,This algorithm treats the graph as a forest and every node it as an individual tree. A tree connects to another only and only if it has least cost among all available options and does not violate MST properties.
How Prim's algorithm finds spanning tree?,Prim's algorithm treats the nodes as a single tree and keeps on adding new nodes to the spanning tree from the given graph.
What is hashing?,"Hashing is a technique to convert a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array. By using hash tables, we can create an associative data storage where data index can be find by providing its key values."
What is interpolation search technique?,Interpolation search is an improved variant of binary search. This search algorithm works on the probing position of required value.
